# Event_Management_System

Objective 
The objective of this assessment is to build a menu driven console-based application using 
Core Java concepts based on a scenario.  
By the end of this assessment, you should be able to 
▪ Create menu driven application 
• Return values 
• Update values 
• Delete values 
• Add new values 
Overview - Scenario and Design 
You’ve been asked to design and implement a Java console-based application for event 
management. There are two major components/classes, Event and Attendee. Attendees can 
attend one or more events, so your event object should contain a list of attendees. 
They want to be able to be able to do the following: 
▪ List all the events in the system 
▪ List an individual event 
▪ Edit an event 
▪ Delete an event 
▪ List the attendees attending an event 
▪ Add an attendee to an event 
▪ Delete an attendee from an event 
The type of design you want to have is what happens at each user choice.  
For example 
*************************************** MENU *********************************************** 
1. List All Events  
2. List an individual event 
3. Edit an event  
4. Delete an event 
5. List the attendees attending an event

6. Add an attendee to an event 
7. Delete an attendee from an event
